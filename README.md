# Social Media Prototype

## Course Assignment
<details>
<summary><strong>JavaScript 2</strong></summary>
The Goal was to build a client-side social media application using my knowledge of JavaScript. This application will allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update & Delete) on their own posts as well as allow for additional features in the future, such as following/unfollowing users, commenting on posts and reacting to a post.

<summary><strong>CSS Frameworks</strong></summary>
The Goal was to apply my own knowlegde of Tailwind or Bootstrap & SASS to build a responsive front-end for a social media application. 
I used Tailwind for this project and deleted CSS files so only the new style would function and show up on the screen.
